This is a tiny tool to perform an EMV transaction, used during my talk
at 29c3.

# Prerequisites

This only works with Ruby 1.8.

you'll need to install the following gems:

* smartcard (https://github.com/costan/smartcard)
* tlv (https://github.com/a2800276/tlv/)
* hexy (https://github.com/a2800276/hexy)

# Usage

irb --noinspect smartshell.rb

# Limitations

Currently the implementation is geared toward my talk, it's only meant
to get started. The only CA key installed is for the demo card I'm using
during my talk. I also cheated a bit and don't actually decipher the
Issuer Key from the data provided in the card, so the certificate
extraction remains to be implemented as does data analysis, DDA, CDA,
encrypted PIN and almost everything else. THIS IS JUST FOR FUN and
shouldn't be used for any other purpose.
